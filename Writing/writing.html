            Today is going to be a good day and here’s why: Today, you will do the most amazing thing. No, it won’t be opening your eyes or finding the courage to crawl out of that one perfectly warm spot in your covers. It wasn’t brushing your teeth, despite the fact that you did it for the full two minutes. It wasn’t doing your hair and makeup in such a subtle way that you think other people won’t notice, but they do. It wasn’t an award or a test. It wasn’t a position or a shiny medal. It wasn’t when you read the most engrossing chapter of a book or when you watched those TV characters finally get together. It wasn’t that hilarious moment where you and your friend make eye contact at just the right time. It wasn’t when they smiled back at you. It wasn’t when your parents told you they’re proud of you. It wasn’t when your teacher told you the secret life in a lecture. It wasn’t flying around the entire world two and a half times. (You wanted to stop in Europe). Today you did the most amazing thing: Today you exist, and that is enough.

                    Today’s going to be a good day, and here’s why: You’re breathing. Breathing is a good start. It doesn’t have to be a perfect day, one you’ve dreamed of since you were small. Things don’t have to fall into place. People don’t have to respect you or apologize for how they’ve hurt you. You just have to get through it, and that’s enough. The people that count are one word away, and that makes it better. Your failures don’t define you, and that’s all you need. Your scars don’t need to disappear. Your quirks don’t need to be masked over. You don’t need to try so hard. You just need to breathe, and that’s enough.

                    Today’s going to be a great day, and here’s why: You’re not running. There’s no reason to. You have people who love you and care about your well-being. You have a safe place to live and a comfortable place to sleep. When there’s yelling in the house, it’s your siblings having fun. You’re warm. You have clothes that fit. You have food when you’re hungry. You have a place to stay. You have people who want you. You have safety and security. Whenever things get tough, you can remember that all of those unpleasant emotions are just proof that you’re still here and you’re still feeling, breathing, and living. It’s going to be a great day, a great week, and a great year. 
Stay up late to watch the stars. Get up at dawn to see daybreak. Take a deep breath, live your life to the fullest, and enjoy the little things.

                    Today is going to be an average day, and that’s great. Smooth pathways form a path from coast to coast of today, and unless you break off into the path less kept, everything will be just fine. You’ve done this hundreds of times before, and today won’t be any different. Just manage your time and everything will be alright. Maybe you’ll play a game when you get home, or spend some time with friends. Whichever way you go, you’ll be doing great. You are not running from life; life is running from you, and you will chase it down. Improve your character, meet your deadlines, and make your average day– a great day.

                    Today is going to be a better day, and here’s why: You’re surrounded by people who care about you, even if it doesn’t always seem like it. You’re not alone. Life can be challenging, and it's natural to feel overwhelmed or disconnected. It's important to remember that you are never truly alone. Even during difficult moments, there are people who genuinely care about your well-being and are there to support you. Sometimes, it might be hard to recognize the love and care around you, especially when you're going through a tough time. Just keep pushing through the hard times and you will find yourself.

                    Today is going to be a good day and here's why: You’re going to wake up and slide out of the perfectly warm sheets. You’re going to be calm today, you have your people. You won't be stressed, you’ll take down everything, one step at a time. You wont get overwhelmed, even when you feel beaten, just breathe. You’re loved, and will show love to others in case they don't receive it. You’ll continue to do your best for others and yourself, and that's great. Today wasn’t a good day because of any of these specific things. But the best part of you today is the courage displayed to do them.
