    <h2>Our Misson Statement</h2>

    <p>
        The Foundation for Helping Others Prevent & End mental health stigma, also known as the H.O.P.E. Foundation, was
        created as a school project inspired by the musical Dear Evan Hansen. The purpose of this website is to provide resources 
        and let others see that someone else is experiencing similar issues. Mental health is an important topic and shouldn’t be 
        considered taboo. Ending the stigma around related topics will help others realize that they are not alone and nothing is wrong 
        with having a tough time.
