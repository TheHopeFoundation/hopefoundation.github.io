    <p>
        The Foundation for Helpful Outreach Promoting Emapthy, also known as the H.O.P.E. Foundation, was created as a school project inspired by the 
        musical Dear Evan Hansen. The purpose of this website is to provide resources and let others see that someone else is experiencing similar issues. 
        Mental health is an important topic and shouldnâ€™t be considered taboo. Ending the stigma around related topics will help others realize that they 
        are not alone and nothing is wrong with having a tough time.
