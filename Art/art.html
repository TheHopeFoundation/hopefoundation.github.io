        In Dear Evan Hansen, trees play a significant role in the symbolism. Several songs reference 
        trees as well as the plot itself. This is why we decided to make a tree. It has different colored
        fruit to represent how everyone is unique and different. These differences can also make people 
        feel alone in life and as though no one understands them, similarly to the song Waving Through a 
        Window, which the art piece is named after. The tree trunk is painted brown and the text is painted 
        in light brown, to give it a more gentle appearance. We chose the line “Did you fall? Or did you let go?” 
        because it shows a moment of self reflection between Evan and his internal struggles. It is the first time 
        he really admits to himself that he tried to commit suicide. It is in this admission to himself that he is 
        able to move forward and understand what happened to Connor, eventually revealing the truth to the Murphy's 
        and opening himself up to his Mom. This allows him to finally get the help that he has been resisting for so 
        long. The line on its own can simply be interpreted as a deeper inquiry into the actions of someone who has 
        given up on something, whether by choice or not.

       Someone who struggles with perfectionism and people-pleasing can overexert themselves in order to fulfill the needs 
       of others. Doing so can cause the person to feel drained and lack happiness in themselves. The drawing shows a potted 
       plant emptying out its water to provide nutrients to the others, but in the process, its own soil becomes dry. This is 
       symbolic of how pouring your energy into the needs of others can take way from what you need from yourself.

        This piece was a collaborative project between Lucy Molnar, Cole Markulis, Eric Tiller, and Patricia Turner. Instead of a canvas, 
        the painting was done on a mannequin head to focus on the theme of mental health and mental illness. Each section was done by a 
        different artist to include some unique perspectives and experiences surrounding mental health. Lucy chose to paint her section 
        in black and white to demonstrate the lack of emotions felt by someone suffering from depression. She painted flower petals falling 
        off of a flower to represent a person with failing mental health and how it might feel as though they have lost everything that once 
        made them happy. Eric painted his section in solid gray with a red eye to represent the monotone feeling that comes when someone is 
        struggling to feel any emotions. The eye is red to represent the exhaustion caused by stress and insomnia. He put tape over the mouth 
        because it can be hard for people in a negative state of mine to express how they are feeling. Patty created a bright, fading design 
        with yellow to highlight the misconception that everyone is happy unless otherwise stated and dark blue for the idea that, as you go 
        deeper and get to know someone better, you might find that they are in a very dark place, despite pretending to be fine. Cole painted 
        his section in black and white with messy spirals to symbolize the frustration, confusion, and stress that comes with being in a poor 
        state of mental health.

            My art piece is based on how controlling and overpowering depression can be. It depicts a man hanging on a noose by a personification 
            of a hand of depression. On the top of the paper, it reads: “The “helping” hand of depression” as a way of showing depression isn’t always 
            the answer and it can be helped.

            My artwork portrays the use of phones and social media and how they can affect a young person's brain. Things like social isolation and 
            Comparison and self-esteem can affect a person's mental health and cause them to fall into a deep hole. Potentially losing themselves and
             their drive to pursue their own personal goals and be themselves. Instead they base their lives off of influencers, this causes a distorted perception of reality. Causing people to expect their life to be as flashy, rich, and famous as these people they see online.

            We walk by countless people every day who have something going on in their lives, and it’s really important that we check in on people, not 
            just the ones we love or are close with, but everyone because not everyone has someone who checks in on them. Some people really do feel alone.
            My piece shows that even if someone always looks fine, it's still important that we check in and show we care because they may not be as fine as 
            we thought. I was originally going to do this painting physically but decided to do it digitally instead.

            For my art piece the theme is a healthy mindset vs a toxic mindset. I chose a tree as the main symbolism of the mindset. On the left side is the healthy mindset that has a thriving tree with the blue skies, vibrant hills, overall just really positive. On the right side is a thinner tree that’s darker with no leaves that’s kind of dying. The hills are darker and it has red skies to show that somethings is different or off when you look at it. Mainly with the toxic or unhealthy mindset it doesn’t give you happy/positive energy. Overall this was to show the energy or vibe you would get if you were to look at a toxic/unhealthy mindset vs a healthy mindset.
