    <p> 
        In Dear Evan Hansen, trees play a significant role in the symbolism. Several songs reference 
        trees as well as the plot itself. This is why we decided to make a tree. It has different colored
        fruit to represent how everyone is unique and different. These differences can also make people 
        feel alone in life and as though no one understands them, similarly to the song Waving Through a 
        Window, which the art piece is named after. The tree trunk is painted brown and the text is painted 
        in light brown, to give it a more gentle appearance. We chose the line “Did you fall? Or did you let go?” 
        because it shows a moment of self reflection between Evan and his internal struggles. It is the first time 
        he really admits to himself that he tried to commit suicide. It is in this admission to himself that he is 
        able to move forward and understand what happened to Connor, eventually revealing the truth to the Murphy's 
        and opening himself up to his Mom. This allows him to finally get the help that he has been resisting for so 
        long. The line on its own can simply be interpreted as a deeper inquiry into the actions of someone who has 
        given up on something, whether by choice or not.

    <p>
       Someone who struggles with perfectionism and people-pleasing can overexert themselves in order to fulfill the needs 
       of others. Doing so can cause the person to feel drained and lack happiness in themselves. The drawing shows a potted 
       plant emptying out its water to provide nutrients to the others, but in the process, its own soil becomes dry. This is 
       symbolic of how pouring your energy into the needs of others can take way from what you need from yourself.
